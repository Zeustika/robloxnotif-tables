# robloxnotif
Sorry this only works on windows 10!

## setup
- 1: download the code
- 2: install dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- 3: add config stuff: create a file called `config.json` and follow this format:
```json
{
  "name": "YOUR NAME",
  "usernames": {
    "USERID": "NICKNAME",
    "USERID": "NICKNAME"
  }
}
```
* replace `YOUR NAME` with what you want robloxnotif to call you
* replace `USERID` with the person you want to get notified about's userid
* replace `NICKNAME` with whatever you want can be their username or something like Roblox Pro

- 4: OPTIONAL: create login stuff: create a file called `ROBLOSECURITY.json` and follow this format:
DON'T GIVE OUT YOUR ROBLOSECURITY TO JUST ANYONE, YOUR ROBLOSECURITY IS BASICALLY YOUR PASSWORD! IF SOMEONE ELSE GETS YOUR ROBLOSECURITY THEY CAN LOGIN AS YOU AND STEAL EVERYTHING YOU OWN ON ROBLOX!
```json
{
  "ROBLOSECURITY": "YOUR ROBLOSECURITY"
}
```
* replace `YOUR ROBLOSECURITY` with your ROBLOSECURITY cookie, if you know how to do that do that ok

## how to use
